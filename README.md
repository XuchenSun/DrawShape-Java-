This project is divided into 11 subtasks. If we assumed that this project is finished by one process:Xuchen, the time will be 11 weeks. This week we use "synchronizabl multiprocessing developing mode", and the time will be 8 weeks because some tasks are not parallel(The shared codes are stored in EverydayCodes Folder). Therefore, according to Amdahl's law the speedup is 137.5%

2020-11-23 Add function of objectId++ and adding image and music, but codes still need to be improved.

2020-11-24 Xuchen pushed codes of Demo1 and Demo2 to gitlab and add functions: print attributes of object into screen.

2020-11-30 Xuchen finished design for functions of editing objects and is doing state and animation design now. Class model is divided into 9 subclass in model package.
